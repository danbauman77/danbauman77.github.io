<p>It can be hard to divine who is behind debt-relief websites, in part because the relationships between the companies can be complex. Using information from legal orders, domain registrations, and state-incorporation documents,&nbsp;<em>The Chronicle</em> created this chart to visualize the connections among four individuals and the companies with which they have been affiliated.</p>
<p>With the closing of Student Loan Solutions LLC in 2008,&nbsp;six companies emerged, focused on student-loan relief services. Mouse over the chart to find details on the companies and links that document their relationships.</p>
