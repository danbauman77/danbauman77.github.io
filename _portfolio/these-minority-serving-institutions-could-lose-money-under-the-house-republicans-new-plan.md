<p style="color:black">Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives are expected to release a bill this week that would <a class="Link" href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/House-Republicans-Eye-Sweeping/241908" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-cms-ai="0">reauthorize the Higher Education Act of 1965,</a> and one proposal could adversely affect minority-serving institutions.</p>

<p style="color:black">According to <em><a class="Link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/house-gop-to-propose-sweeping-changes-to-higher-education-1511956800" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-cms-ai="0">The Wall Street Journal,</a></em> the bill — which seeks to revise higher education’s landmark law — will include a provision that would stiffen eligibility requirements for colleges, including historically black colleges, Hispanic-serving institutions, and other minority-serving institutions, to receive funds under Title III and Title V of the law. Those programs are intended to help minority-serving institutions increase academic resources and offerings, among other things. Under the bill, the institutions would be required to graduate or transfer at least 25 percent of their students.</p>

<p style="color:black">The details of the plan beyond that are few and far between, and once the bill is released, it is likely to look much different than the first draft.</p>

<p style="color:black">According to a <em>Chronicle</em> analysis, based on first-year, full-time student graduation or transfer rates, at least 61 institutions that receive Title III or Title V money fall below the 30-percent mark, at or near ineligibility. And 36 institutions would be ineligible to receive funds if the Republican plan, as it’s been reported, were to pass.</p>

<p style="color:black">Here are the institutions that could be affected:</p>
