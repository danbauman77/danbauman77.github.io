<h3 style="color:black">Excerpted:</h3>

<p style="color:black"><i>A bill that would further restrict where the state’s most serious sex offenders could live — and give cities and counties the ability to restrict them even more — is progressing in the Legislature.</i></p>

<p style="color:black">...</p>

<p style="color:black"><i>Currently, “Level 3” sex offenders — the most likely to re-offend — cannot live “near” schools, according to state law. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Jim Newberger, R-Becker, and put before the House’s public safety committee on&nbsp;Tuesday, would expand that restrictions to parks, as well as “other locations frequented by children.”</i></p>

<p style="color:black">...</p>

<p style="color:black"><i>But in places like St. Paul — with a dense concentration of parks — that’s largely what the language would do.</i></p>

<p style="color:black"><i>In St. Paul, roughly 97 percent of all properties are within a half-mile of a park. In Minneapolis, the total is 95 percent, city officials said.</i></p>
