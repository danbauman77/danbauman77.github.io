	Harassment can also consist of nonverbal conduct, such as hazing, 
practical jokes, damage to property, and physical assault. In the case 
of sexual harassment and other sex-based misconduct, sexual conduct is 
often central to the offense. These forms of harassment are prohibited 
by Policy 3-3031 of the Handbook of Operating Procedures, and by the 
Regents’ Rules and Regulations, Rule 30105. Some forms of harassment 
violate the Prohibition of Campus Violence, Policy 8-1010, in the 
Handbook of Operating Procedures. Harassment directed at an individual 
or group of individuals because of race, sex, or certain other 
characteristics is prohibited by Handbook of Operating Procedures 
3-3020. For enhanced sanctions for disciplinary offenses motivated by 
the race, color, or national origin of a student harmed by the offense, 
see Subsection 11–701(b) of the Institutional Rules. To the extent of 
any conflict in the definition of verbal harassment, the more detailed 
definition in this Section controls.</span></a></li>

	An essential part of higher education is to learn to separate 
substantive argument from personal offense. Inherent in freely exploring
 ideas and engaging in educational inquiry is discussion where 
controversial and offensive ideas may be expressed and even welcomed in 
furtherance of free inquiry and pursuit of knowledge. We strive as a 
university community to express even the deepest disagreements in a 
manner that reflects mutual respect, understanding, and sensitivity 
within the University and in the larger society. These are community 
norms, even though they cannot be enforced by disciplinary rules. 
Sometimes community members may engage in a manner that falls short of 
the desired norms, but this failure does not convert the communication 
at issue to harassment or a conduct violation.</span></a></li>

 harassment has been interpreted very narrowly by the federal courts.

		The term “disruption” and its variants, as used in this Rule, are 
distinct from and broader than the phrase “disruption of activities,” as
 used in the Regents’ Rules and Regulations, Rule 30103, Number 2, 
Section 2, and the phrase “disruptive activities,” as used in the 
Regents’ Rules and Regulations, Rule 40502. This Rule is concerned not 
only with deliberate disruption, but also with scheduling and 
coordination of events to manage or minimize the inevitable conflicts 
between legitimate events conducted in close proximity, and to preserve 
the University’s ability to execute its functions.&nbsp;</span></a></li>

 in the most extreme cases, interference and disruption are unavoidably 
contextual. Intentional physical interference with other persons is 
nearly always disrupt</strong>ive <strong>in any context. Interfering 
with traffic depends on the relation between the volume of traffic and 
the size of the passageway left open. D</strong>isrupti<strong>ve noise 
is the most contextual of all, because it typically depends on factors 
like the time of day and the occurrence of other activities. Any 
distracting sound may disrupt a memorial service. Any sound sufficiently
 loud or persistent to make concentration difficult may disrupt a class 
or library. Occasional heckling in the speaker’s pauses may not disrupt a
 political speech, but persistent heckling that prevents listeners from 
hearing the speaker does disrupt a political</strong> speech<strong>. These illustrations may be helpful, but none of them includes enough context to be taken as a rule. We cannot escape rely</strong>ing <strong>on </strong>the <strong>judgment and fairness of </strong>University<strong>
 authorities in particular cases. In this context, where difficult

ability to prepare for and take their final exams. The University 
prohibits these activities during the week of final exams and the week

	Potentially disruptive events can often proceed without disruption if 
participants, administrators, and law enforcement officials cooperate to
 avoid disruption without stopping the event. In cases of marginal or 
unintentional disruption, administrators and law enforcement officials 
should clearly state what they consider disruptive and seek voluntary 
compliance before stopping the event or resorting to disciplinary 
charges or arrest.</span></a></li>

	The University is responsible for safety on campus. During periods of 
disruption as determined by the president, president's delegate, dean of
 students, or other university official charged with managing 
activities, events, or space, staff may ask an individual to briefly 
open a cooler, ice chest, or other receptacle to allow a visual 
inspection for the presence of weapons or other prohibited items. If a 
person declines to open the container, they may not remain in the area 
with the container capable of holding weapons or other prohibited items.
 Before staff can conduct visual inspections, it must contact the Office
 of the Vice President for Legal Affairs to ensure the course of action 
is reasonable, considering the circumstances, and does not violate the 
law, including but not limited to the Fourth Amendment to the United 
States Constitution. This provision does not modify, limit, or supersede
 security measures and policies concerning student housing, athletic 
events, performances in University venues, or other officially

	Other generally applicable or narrowly localized rules, written and 
unwritten, incidentally limit the time, place, and manner of speech, but
 are too numerous to compile or cross-reference here. For example, 
libraries typically have highly restrictive rules concerning noise; 
laboratories and rooms containing the electrical and mechanical 
infrastructure of the University typically have safety rules and rules 
excluding persons without specific business there; fire and safety codes
 prohibit the obstruction of exits and limit the constriction of 
hallways. Speech within classrooms is generally confined to the subject 
matter of the class; the right to attend a class at all is subject to 
registration and payment of tuition; individual professors may have 
rules of decorum in their classrooms. These “time, place, and manner” 
rules limit the rights of persons to enter and speak in the places to 
which these rules apply.</span></a></li>
    <li class="unchanged"><a class="klax-line-anchor" name="163"></a><a data-line="163" href="#163"><span>
	Reasonable and nondiscriminatory “time, place, and manner” rules 
generally control over the rights of free speech guaranteed in this 
Chapter. But even “time, place, and manner” rules are subject to the 
constitutional right of free speech. Accordingly, such rules must be 
viewpoint neutral and cannot regulate speech more restrictively than 
they regulate other activities that cause the problems to be avoided by 
the rule, or more than is reasonably necessary to serve their purpose. 
Such rules cannot ban unobtrusive forms of communication with no 
potential for disruption even in the specialized environment subject to 
the localized rule. Thus, for example, means of silent expression or 
protest confined to the speaker’s immediate person, such as armbands, 
buttons, and T-shirts, are nearly always protected because they are 
rarely disruptive in any environment.</span></a></li>
